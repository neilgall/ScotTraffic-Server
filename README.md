# ScotTraffic Server

Here lives the server component of ScotTraffic. Yes, it's written in Haskell. I was learning it at the time.
It uses 
[Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

Yes, I know they shouldn't be in the source. To get this fully working you'll need to contact the various
providers and acquire your own. I've put comments in the relevant places.
